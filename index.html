  <h1>Welcome to My Creative Space!</h1>

  <p>Here, I share my journey through the worlds of art and design. You’ll find a mix of my artwork, experiments in HTML & CSS, and insights from my explorations in UI/UX. This is a place where I document my creative process, showcase projects, and maybe even share a few personal musings along the way. Whether you’re here for the art, the code, or a bit of inspiration, I hope you enjoy what you see and feel inspired to explore your own creativity.</p>
